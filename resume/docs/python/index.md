# I'm mainly a python developer

I fell in love with Python because of it's idiomatic and simple approach, yet, an evolving, powerfull and growing language.

???+ note "My Coding style"

    - Good code practices and PEP8
    - Enforcing strict typing in all my newer projects
    - Efficient and readable code
    - Using common and advanced design patterns, and newer language features like Protocols (Stategy, Message Queues...)
    - Managing environment using pyenv or conda, and sometimes some [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/)

## I enjoy sharing knowledge and helping coworkers

???+ tip "Teaching to team members"

    - Teaching newer developers how to setup their IDEs
    - Setting up virtual environments
    - Remote debugging in containers
    - Type hints
    - Projet templating
    - How to create good documentations
